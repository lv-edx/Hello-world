# Hello-world
First time getting to know Github
I started the CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course from Harvard University. To hand in my assignments, I needed to have a Github account. While I'm here I would like to learn more about programming and especially about programming websites. I hope that one day I will be as good to share my code with everyone!
